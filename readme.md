> Setup ssh private keys for git from environment variables

`git-ssh-key` makes it easy to setup ssh keys for git hosting services. It is ideally meant to be used on CI to setup ssh key to access private repos. One of the use case is to install npm packages from private git repos.

It has two prerequisites:-

* You have a ssh key-pair and have added the public key to your git service.
* you have your private key encoded in base64 format and set in appropriate environment variable.

`git-ssh-key` reads from following environment variables based on the git services it supports.

`GIT_SSH_KEY_GITHUB`
`GIT_SSH_KEY_GITLAB`
`GIT_SSH_KEY_BUTBUCKET`

You can then run

```bash
git-ssh-env setup
```

And it will setup ssh keys for all the services for which environment variables are set.

To cleanup when you no longer need the access, run

```bash
git-ssh-env teardown
```

It will remove all the added keys and config.

## Example

See the [example](https://github.com/doshisid/git-ssh-key/tree/master/example) folder to get an idea about how `git-ssh-env` should be used.

In that folder if you open the `package.json` file, you can see that it is dependent on a private package hosted on gitlab. That package is also dependent on a private package hosted on bitbucket. Both those platforms have diffrent keys.
I have added `GIT_SSH_KEY_GITLAB` and `GIT_SSH_KEY_BUTBUCKET` environement variables to Travis CI with respective private
keys in `base64` encoded format.

`index.js` file checks that both the packages were added properly by checking the output.

This test is run on every CI build. You can see the log of the last build [here](https://travis-ci.org/doshisid/git-ssh-key).

## Install

```bash
npm install -g git-ssh-key
```

## Usage

```bash
git-ssh-key [setup|teardown]
```
